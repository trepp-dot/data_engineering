# Data Engineering for Data Science

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of data engineering methods designed to support data science projects. Data engineering is a critical step in the data science workflow, and this program offers a set of functions to help you efficiently prepare and preprocess your data for analysis and modeling.

## Methods

### `load_data()`

This method allows you to load your dataset into memory. You can specify the data source, such as a CSV file or a database connection, and retrieve the data for further processing.

### `clean_data()`

Clean your data with this method. It helps you identify and handle common data quality issues, such as missing values, duplicates, and outliers.

### `set_data_type()`

Ensure that your data types are correct and consistent. This function allows you to specify the data types for different columns in your dataset.

### `print_stats()`

Get a quick overview of your data's statistics, including summary statistics for numeric columns and value counts for categorical columns.

### `extract_features_from_text()`

When working with text data, use this method to extract relevant features that can be used for analysis or modeling. This can include techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

### `one_hot_encoder()`

Convert categorical variables into one-hot encoded format, making them suitable for machine learning algorithms that require numeric inputs.

### `fill_missing_data(method='xgboost')`

Address missing data in your dataset. You can choose from various imputation methods, including XGBoost-based imputation or other strategies of your choice.

### `imbalance_data(method='SMOTE')`

Handle class imbalance issues in your dataset using methods like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) or other techniques as needed.

### `data.plot_data()`

Visualize your data to gain insights and explore patterns. This method provides basic plotting functionality to help you understand your dataset better.

## Getting Started

To use these data engineering methods, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Import the `data_engineering.py` module into your data science project.
3. Utilize the methods listed above to preprocess your data as needed for your specific analysis or modeling tasks.

## Dependencies

This program relies on common data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and XGBoost. Ensure that you have these libraries installed in your Python environment.

## Usage Example

```python
# Import the data engineering module
from data_engineering import DataEngineering

# Load your dataset
data_engineering = DataEngineering()
data_engineering.load_data('your_dataset.csv')

# Clean the data
data_engineering.clean_data()

# Set data types
data_engineering.set_data_type()

# Print data statistics
data_engineering.print_stats()

# Extract features from text data
data_engineering.extract_features_from_text()

# One-hot encode categorical variables
data_engineering.one_hot_encoder()

# Fill missing data using XGBoost-based imputation
data_engineering.fill_missing_data()

# Handle class imbalance using SMOTE
data_engineering.imbalance_data()

# Visualize your data
data_engineering.data.plot_data()
```

Feel free to customize and extend these methods to suit the specific requirements of your data science project.
